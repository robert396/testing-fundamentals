<h1 id="why-is-testing-necessary">Why Is Testing Necessary?</h1>
<p>In this day and age computers are used in practically everything as such failures can be expensive and or life threatening.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A computer controlled radiation and x-ray treatment machine for cancer</li>
<li>A cooling system for a nuclear power plant</li>
</ul>
<p>If a fault occurs in either of the given examples it could lead to dangerous consequences.</p>
<h2 id="causes-of-software-defects">Causes of Software Defects</h2>
<p>The cause of a software defect normally falls into the following three step process.</p>
<ul>
<li>A person makes an <strong>error</strong> (<strong>mistake</strong>)...</li>
<li>... that may create a <strong>defect</strong> (<strong>fault</strong> or <strong>bug</strong>) in the software <em>or documents</em>...</li>
<li>... which in software <em>may</em> cause a <strong>failure</strong> in operation</li>
</ul>
<p>Humans are <strong>not</strong> perfect and <strong><em>can/will</em></strong> make mistakes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Possibly caused by such things are pressure of work, tight deadlines, complex code, other system interactions
and changing or unfamiliar technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failures can also be caused by environmental factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Radiation, magnetism, electronic fields, complex code, complexity of infrastructure and pollution.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-role-of-testing">The Role of Testing</h2>
<p>Rigorous testing of <strong>systems</strong> and <strong>documents</strong> can help reduce the risk of <strong>failure</strong> and improve the <strong>quality</strong>
of systems when they go in to use.</p>
<p>Software testing may also need to meet; <strong>Legal</strong> requirements, <strong>Contractual</strong> requirements or Industry-specific standards.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible to have a system that works perfectly but fails to meet the requirements.</p>
<h2 id="testing-and-quality">Testing and Quality</h2>
<p>Testing on its own does not improve the quality of the software, but until we test it, we cannot
know what the quality of the software is.</p>
<p>Quality is usually measured by the sum of <strong>defects</strong> found and how serious they are for both <strong>functional</strong>
and <strong>non-functional</strong> characteristics of a system.</p>
<h2 id="the-six-quality-characteristics">The Six Quality Characteristics</h2>
<p>The six characteristics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functionality</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Efficiency</li>
<li>Maintainability</li>
<li>Portability</li>
</ul>
<p>The first characteristic is tested by <strong>functional</strong> testing - which is testing what the system does, and not how 
it does it.</p>
<p>The last five characteristics are all tested by <strong>non-functional</strong> testing - which is testing how well it does.</p>
<h2 id="quality-and-risk">Quality and Risk</h2>
<p>The results of testing can give confidence in the quality of the software providing; the tests are properly designed
<em>and</em> few or no defects are found <em>or</em> defects found are fixed and the quality improved.</p>
<p>So a properly designed test can reduce risk of the software failing by; providing that a feature or function of the 
software works <em>or</em> by proving that is doesn't!</p>
<p>When designing a test always ask your self the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have I tested everything that needs to be tested?</li>
<li>Have I tested both positive and negatives?</li>
<li>Is there any permutations that I can think of that haven't been covered?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quality-assurance">Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>Quality assurance is defect prevention and not defect detection.</p>
<p>By understanding the root causes of <strong>defects</strong> found, lessons can be learned to improve the process for future projects;
by helping prevent the same <strong>mistakes</strong> (<strong>errors</strong>) from being made - this applies to both testers and developers.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-testing-is-enough">How Much Testing Is Enough?</h2>
<p>Deciding on when the software is good enough requires an assessment of risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical risk - The test environment not being ready on time.</li>
<li>Safety risk - Is there a physical risk to humans should the software fail?</li>
<li>Business risk - Could poor quality software cost the company money?</li>
</ul>
<p>The above are all examples of <strong>Product</strong> risk but there is another type of risk - <strong>Project</strong></p>
<p>An example of a project risk is the project constraints such as; time, budget and even staff</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-testers">The Role of Testers</h2>
<p>It is not up to the testers on when to release the software to the next stage of development or to the customer.</p>
<p>Testers should however offer the relevant information to those that make the decisions so that they can be
properly informed.</p></div>
